## Contents

### Current Experiments
1. **Single-Slit Diffraction**  
   Visualizes the diffraction pattern created by light passing through a single slit, with an interactive projection on the screen.  

2. **Double-Slit Diffraction (No Slit Height)**  
   Simulates the interference patterns produced by two slits, showcasing the effects of varying light and slit parameters.
